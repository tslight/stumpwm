* Global Windows

  Out of the box StumpWM provides tools to navigate windows only within
  group bounds - "windowlist" function seems to be the main, and maybe
  only useful here.

  Sometimes the user wants to manage or even simply overview *all* application
  windows present in X session.

  So, this contrib extension was written with purpose of providing the
  way to manage global windows list in rather straightforward manner.

** Usage

   Add this to your =.stumpwm.d/init.lisp=:

   Load contrib module:

   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (load-module "global-windows")
   #+END_SRC

   And then use functions for global windows navigation:

   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (define-key *root-map* (kbd "C-t") "global-other")
     (define-key *root-map* (kbd "w") "global-windowlist")
     (define-key *root-map* (kbd "C-w") "global-pull-windowlist")
   #+END_SRC

   Moreover there is a couple of util functions exported for the aim of
   user-defined extensions - see source code.
