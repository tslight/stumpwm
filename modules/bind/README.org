* Bind Key

Slightly less clunky that the standard method for key binding. Influenced by
Emacs' [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/blob/master/bind-key.el][bind-key]], but not nearly as powerful or feature rich. This is just a
couple of pretty basic macros..

** Usage

#+begin_src common-lisp
  (load-module "bind")
#+end_src

The syntax is as follows:

#+begin_src common-lisp
  (bind:key
   ,*key-map*
   ("C-M-z" "some-amazing-stumpwm-command")
   ("C-M-y" "some-other-amazing-stumpwm-command"))
#+end_src

** Examples

To bind Emacs to =<Super> + e= & XTerm to =<Super> + t= in the =*top-map*=,
would look like this:

#+begin_src common-lisp
  (bind:key
   ,*top-map*
   ("s-e" "exec emacs")
   ("s-t" "exec xterm"))
#+end_src

To do something similar in the =*root-map*=:

#+begin_src common-lisp
  (bind:key
   ,*root-map*
   ("e" "exec emacs")
   ("t" "exec xterm"))
#+end_src

=<Tab>= and =<Shift+Tab>= to go down and up menus.

#+begin_src common-lisp
  (bind:key
   ,*menu-map*
   ("TAB" 'menu-down)
   ("ISO_Left_Tab" 'menu-up))
#+end_src
